This project was undertaken as part of the Indonesia National Aerial Robotics Competition 2016, where we developed a fixed-wing UAV capable of vertical take-off and landing, similar to a multicopter. Our innovation earned us the title of "1st Runner-Up" in this prestigious competition and later won the Smart City Robot Innovation Contest 2017.

Our goal was to create a UAV that combines the endurance of fixed-wing aircraft with the maneuverability of rotary-wing aircraft. This hybrid VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) UAV addresses critical needs in scenarios such as logistic delivery in remote areas with challenging terrains or urban environments with numerous tall buildings. Both endurance and maneuverability are crucial in these contexts, and our hybrid VTOL UAV offers a perfect solution.

### The Concept

Aircraft generally fall into two categories:
1. **Rotary Wing:** Typically equipped with multiple rotors, offering high maneuverability but limited endurance and energy efficiency.
2. **Fixed Wing:** Provides high endurance for long-range flights but requires a runway for take-off and landing and has limited maneuverability.

Our approach combines the best of both worlds by developing a Hybrid VTOL UAV, named Gatotkaca Ganesha. This unmanned aircraft can take off and land in a small area using its quadcopter mode. After reaching the desired altitude, it transitions to fixed-wing mode for efficient cruising. This design is ideal for use cases such as delivering medical and emergency supplies to disaster-affected areas (e.g., earthquakes), urban logistics, or monitoring forests in hilly or mountainous regions.

This project was undertaken as part of the Indonesia National Aerial Robotics Competition 2017, where we developed one of Indonesia's first Autonomous Folding-Wing UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles). Our innovation earned us the "Best Design" award and the title of "1st Runner-Up" in this prestigious competition.

Our aim was to develop a fixed-wing UAV that is compact, easily deployable, and optimized for operations in challenging terrains. To achieve this, we designed the UAV to be rapidly deployable within a short time frame. It is stored in a tube for easy transport, allowing for the simultaneous launch of multiple aircraft without the need for a runway. Additionally, we worked on developing a coordinated relay system to enable the control of multiple UAVs and extend their communication range.

I was responsible for developing the avionics system of the UAV, ensuring that the electronics and control systems were seamlessly integrated to support autonomous flight and coordinated operations.

## The Challenge

### Issues with Conventional Fixed-Wing UAVs:
- **Transport:** Most UAVs require large storage and transport space.
- **Launch Requirements:** Traditional UAVs often need a runway or specialized launching gear, which must be set up and taken down on site.
- **Communication Limitations:** UAV communication range is typically limited, especially in terrains with obstacles like hills.

## Proposed Solution & Mechanism

To address these challenges, our team developed a tube-launched folding-wing UAV with a coordinated relay system. The UAV can be stored in a tube, making it easy to carry and transport. The integrated pneumatic launch system simplifies deployment, minimizing setup time and effort. Additionally, the coordinated relay system extends the communication range by deploying multiple UAVs that can communicate with each other.

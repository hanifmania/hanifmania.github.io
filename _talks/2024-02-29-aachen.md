Poster Sharing Session about "Empowering Precision Agriculture: Efficient Angle-Aware Coverage for 3D Structure Reconstruction with Drone Teams".

On this day, twelve students from the Department of Information and Automation Systems for Process and Material Technology (IAT) of RWTH Aachen University visited our university, Tokyo Institute of Technology. The visit was organized by the Academy of Excellence for Super Smart Society at Tokyo Tech, and an exchange event was held in the form of a keynote talk and a poster sharing session.

I delivered a poster sharing session with the theme "**Empowering Precision Agriculture: Efficient Angle-Aware Coverage for 3D Structure Reconstruction with Drone Teams**." The poster [can be downloaded here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jOYyRzZOn99DXLwZNlUSJcPGPzJjW--k/view?usp=sharing).

I’m currently a :smile: researcher focusing on robotics and autonomous systems, with a particular interest in coverage control and multi-robot systems. My work involves integrating angle-aware coverage control with real-time map reconstruction algorithms, aimed at optimizing UAV-based monitoring and 3D reconstruction.

I’ve previously worked on deep learning models for agricultural applications, particularly in adapting models for crop-specific detection, such as wheat head detection and rice ear detection. My research spans a range of topics from real-time feedback mechanisms in robotics to the intersection of AI and agricultural technologies.

I completed my studies in Electrical and Computer Engineering, with a strong emphasis on robotics, AI, and computer vision. My academic journey has been shaped by my passion for exploring how intelligent systems can interact with the real world, especially in dynamic environments.

You’ll find me working at the intersection of robotics, computer vision, and AI. My research goal is to advance the capabilities of autonomous systems, enabling them to perform complex tasks in uncertain environments. I believe in the potential of robots to revolutionize industries and improve our quality of life through automation and intelligent decision-making.

When I’m not immersed in research, you’ll find me exploring new technologies or delving into the latest advancements in AI and robotics.
